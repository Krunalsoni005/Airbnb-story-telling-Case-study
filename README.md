 Recommedation :-
               The data shows customer preferences based on number of reviews, price and location. 
 We can conclude that the highest preferred listings are ones that offer private rooms, specifically offering the entire home/apartment setting as we have seen consistently higher reviews per month and totally in these cases. 
 The listings in Manhattan region have the highest consistent reviews per month but areas such as Bedford-Stuyvesant and Williamsburg which are part of Brooklyn have shown highest number of reviews overall even with higher pricing. 
 Customer preferences of private room and entire home are more but the availability of  shared rooms are high compared to other so we need to increase private room, and entire home for increase revenue based on customer preference area Distribution of  price in each neighboured where highest is Manhattan, Brooklyn and lowest in Staten island.
